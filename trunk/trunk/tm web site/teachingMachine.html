   <h2>Introductory Video</h2>
   <p>This is a <a href="premier/tm.htm" target="_top">five
     minute introductory video to the Teaching Machine</a> which shows off much
     of what it can do.</p>
     <h2>The Recipe Approach</h2>
     <p> It is commonplace in teaching IT (as opposed to computer science or
       engineering) to use what might best be termed a recipe based approach.
       That is, one takes a particular, usually narrowly focused, task and lays
       out the steps that must be taken to accomplish it. Teaching an entire
       technology then simply becomes a matter of presenting a large number of
       such recipes, generally starting with the simplest and most commonplace
       (saving a file) and working your way out to the most esoteric (separating
       a document into content and style by using templates or stylesheets).</p>
     <p>This approach is widely used in teaching applications such as word processing.
       Increasingly today it has taken over (one is tempted to say ' infected')
       help systems. Even were the approach the best for learning applications
       (and that is at least arguable) it is a poor way for computer science
       and engineering students to learn something as fundamental to their careers
       as programming. Yet if you work with students in the laboratory as they
       attempt to develop their programming skills, you discover that is the
       approach that many of them seek out on their own. In part, it is likely
       that is because it is the approach many of them are familiar with from
       high school which tends to focus on IT training instead of computer science. </p>
     <h2>Instructing the Machine</h2>
     <p>When skilled programmers write a line of computer code they are doing
       nothing more or less than issuing an instruction to a machine. Given the
       complexity of modern computers, how can we expect anyone to carry out
       such a task unless they have a thorough understanding of the machine they
	   are trying to instruct?</p>
<div class="sidebarRight">
  <p><strong>student response to an anonymous survey</strong></br>
  <i>When I write code, I visualize how the Teaching Machine would translate it.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Unhappily, the recipe-based approach to IT training
       does a very poor job of developing the mental models necessary for that
       understanding. It's as if we had taught them how to drive in high school
       and now expect them to design cars. Lacking a coherent model and faced
       with a short term deadline students perforce fall back on the <em>what
       do I have to do to get this working?</em> approach they learned as teenagers.
       What is needed is a way to help them develop a clear mental model of the
       machine. We need to take them under the hood. </p>
     <p>That begs the question, "What is the machine?" The obvious answer is
       the microprocessor but that answer, fortunately, is wrong. Fortunate because
       we clearly do not want to require every student to take a course in microprocessors
       before they are allowed to tackle programming.</p>
     <h2>Getting Underneath the Hood </h2>
 <p>The machine we "talk to" when we program is an abstraction, part microprocessor,
       part compiler, part memory manager. For example, when we declare a variable
       in a modern object-oriented language like C++ or Java, most experienced
       programmers would understand that space is being set aside in memory and
       good ones would be aware whether it was on the heap or the stack. A simple
       declaration involves at once</p>
     <ol>
       <li>a notion of the physical computer, i.e. the memory.</li>
       <li>a grasp of the compiler's role in deciding where the storage is allocated.</li>
       <li>the run time management of the storage</li>
     </ol>
     <div class="sidebarRight">
       <p>The Teaching Machine is an abstraction, part microprocessor, part compiler,
         part memory manager.</p>
     </div>
     <p> The Teaching Machine presents an integrated abstraction of the <em>computer-we-program</em> (different
       from the more familiar <em>computer-we-use</em>) which allows students
       to follow, in a consistent and revealing way, the unfolding state of the
       machine as code is processed. </p>
     <p>A large applet (more of an <em>appletiisimo</em>) it is integrated directly
       into teaching web pages, allowing examples to be displayed and discussed
       as they would in a textbook, yet be animated at will.</p>
     <h2>Delivery Modes</h2>
     <p>Our teaching web pages have been used in the following ways: </p>
     <dl>
       <dt>In class</dt>
       <dd> as lecture notes, replacing overheads. Instructors display the examples
         in class, as part of the notes, then run them in the Teaching Machine.
         Freed from having to laboriously detail the evolution of the machine's
         state on the board, the instructor can present more cycles than possible
         manually and spend more time on discussion. Backing up to a previous
         state is easy (and there's no danger it has been already erased). Instructors
         report enjoying the classes more and students report them as being more
         effective. </dd>
       <dt>Self-study</dt>
       <dd>either off the course web site or from a provided CD, students may
         re-animate what examples they choose, whenever they choose, stepping
         through them at their own rate. In some cases we have provided videos
         of the instructor walking through the example. The student sees the
         Teaching Machine evolve and hears the instructor's voice-over discussion,
         just as if the dynamic experience had been recorded in class.</dd>
       <dt>Notes</dt>
       <dd>Careful use of stylesheets together with a modest amount of manual
         work allows printed versions of the course notes to be produced, which
         some students prefer to web-based notes when animation is not required.</dd>
       <dt>Distance Education</dt>
       <dd>A version of our introductory on-campus course in<em>
           Introductory Programming</em> was offered to a small no. of students
           through <a href="http://www.distance.mun.ca">Memorial's
           Distance Education and Learning Technologies (DELT)</a>. The technology
           coexisted comfortably with the webCT course management software.</dd>
     </dl>
     <h2>See it in Action</h2>
     <p>The best way to see it in action is to look at one of the <a href="eTexts.html">courses</a> we
       have included on the web site.   </p>
