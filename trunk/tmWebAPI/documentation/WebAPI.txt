Proposed Web API for the Teaching Machine
==========================================

History: Version 0. TSN 2015 Nov 11.
  Version 1. TSN 2015 Nov 12. Added retire.
  Version 2. TSN 2015 Dec 22. Changes to how state information is returned from the remote TM

Objective: Allow Remote Teaching Machines (RTM) to be used as a web service.

This is a RESTless API!

Section 0.  General comments on the Web API
--------------------------------------------

GET vs POST:
............

Since the results of a GET may be cached, it is important that all requests be sent using
the HTTP POST method.

On parameters
..............

Parameters are extra bits of information that go along with the request.
We could implement parameters either by putting them in a query string (this is the jquery
default) or by passing in a JSON encoded object in the request body (also easy to do in
jquery).  My preference is for the later, as it is symmetric with the response.

Response HTTP status code
..........................

Responses in HTTP are considered successes or failures based on 
their HTTP  status.  Status 200 means success.  The API below deals only with success
cases.  I.e. the  server should return a response with HTTP status code equal to 200
even in the case that it can't fulfill the request because of some problem such as
a bad or retired GUID.   Other codes might be used if the request was in error.  For
example if the URL is
    <BaseURL>/fuddleDuddle
then the HTTP status code would be 404. And if the parameters can't be parsed, then 
status code 400 makes sense.  Missing required parameters would also give a 400.  However
if say a bad or retired GUID is sent or a request is made when the remote TM is in the wrong state, then HTTP status would be 200.  HTTP status codes between 201 and 299 
inclusive should be avoided.

Responses
..........

Assuming the HTTP response status is 200, each request results in a response object. This
object should be a JSON encoded object in the body of the response.

The "status" field of the responses
....................................

Independent of the HTTP status codes, the API defines its own set of statuses. These
are returned in the "status" field of the response.  Generally the value of the "status"
field indicates the state of a remote TM.

There is a subtle distinction between states and statuses.  All possible states of the
remote TM are statuses, but some statuses are not states. The states or the remote TM are
as listed in interface TMStatusCode. They are
    /** Status Code -- No Evaluator is present.*/
    NO_EVALUATOR = 0
    
    /**   Not used in Web API  */
    READY_TO_COMPILE = 1
    
    /**  Status Code -- Compilation failed. */
    DID_NOT_COMPILE = 2
    
    /**  Status Code -- Compilation was successful. Initialization has not been done.*/
    COMPILED = 3
    
    /**  Status Code -- Ready for next step. */
    READY = 4
    
    /**  Not used in Web API */
    BUSY_EVALUATING = 5
    
    /**  Status Code -- The program has run to completion. */
    EXECUTION_COMPLETE = 6
    
    /**  Status Code -- The program has crashed or otherwise completed in an unpleasant way. */
    EXECUTION_FAILED = 7 

[Implementation Note: These states are stored in the RTMs evaluator object (which in
turn, keeps them in its virtual machine state object.) However NO_EVALUATOR can not be
stored in the evaluator object since there isn't one. In the TMBigApplet, the
NO_EVALUATOR state is represented by the evaluator pointer being null.]

The "status" field of the response will usually hold one of the above states.
It will be the state of the RTM after the request has been processed. For example
a "go" request might start with the RTM in the READY state and end with it being
in the EXECUTION_COMPLETE state.  In this case the "status" field of the response
would be EXECUTION_COMPLETE.

However there are a few cases where it does not make sense for the response
to contain the state of the RTM.  For these cases, there are some additional values
that the "status" field can take on.
   /** Status Code -- There is no RTM with that GUID */
   BAD_GUID = -1
   
   /** Status Code -- There was an RTM with that GUID, but it no longer exists. */
   RETIRED = -2
   
   /** Status Code -- RTM could not be created. */
   FAILED = -3
   
   /** Status Code -- The request succeeded. */
   SUCCEEDED = -4

The idea behind RETIRED is that if a remote TM is not used for a long time, the server might delete it.

Section 1. State Information
-----------------------------

Wanted parameters
.................

Many methods can return information about the state of the remoteTM.
The request specifies what information is wanted by the client.
For example
* If the request contains an expressionWanted parameter equal to "yes",
the response must contain the current state of the expression being evaluated
(see the "expression" field below for details).
* If the value of the "expressionWanted" parameter is
equal to "maybe", the response would contain an "expression" field unless the
value of that field would be the same as the value of the field in the most recent
response that had that field. I.e. the client gets a new value iff it is different
from the old value.
* If there is no "expressionWanted" parameter or its value is "no", there
will be no "expression" field in the response.

All together there are the following "wanted parameters" and corresponding response fields
   expressionWanted        expression
   outputWanted			   output
   consoleWanted           console
   codeWanted              code
   sourceCoordinatesWanted sourceCoordinates

The "expression" field of the responses
.........................................

Many of the api calls have an "expression" field in the response. This is a specially
encoded string that shows the current state of the execution of the current expression.
Details of the encoding can be found in the TM's source code.

The "console" field of the responses:
......................................

Many of the api calls have a "console" field. This is an array of specially encoded
strings that shows the current state of the console.  By default the characters represent
output.  However, within each line, \ufffe indicates the start of input and \uffff
indicates the resumption of output.  Note that tabs are not expanded, so tab expansion
needs to be done on the client.

The "output" field of the responses:
......................................

Many of the api calls have a "console" field. This is an array of 
strings that shows data that has been output to the console.  It differs from "console"
in that it does not show any input.  There is no special encoding.

The "code" field of the responses:
..................................
The "code" field consists of all the currently selected lines
in the current source file.    It is an array of objects
where each object has three fields.
   chars -- a string
   coords -- an object (see below for details)
   markup -- an array of objects (see below for details) sorted by column
The chars of course represent the line of code.

(See class tm.virtualMachine.CodeStore for details.  The code field corresponds to 
the array of lines one gets from the evaluator as follows
   SourceCoords focus = evaluator.getCodeFocus();
   TMFile file = focus.getFile() ;
   int n = evaluator.getNumSelectedCodeLines(file, false) ;
   for( int i=0; i < n ; ++i ) {
       CodeLine line = evaluator.getSelectedCodeLine(file, false, i);
       ...
   }
)
   
The coords objects have fields fileName, which is a string, and line which is an int.

Each markup object is an object with two or three fields
   column -- an int
   command -- an int
   tagSet -- a string
For details concerning markup, see class tm.interfaces.MarkUp in the TM source code.
The tagSet string is only needed when the command is CHANGE_TAG_SET (i.e. 5) and
will be a string of lower-case letters (a-z) without duplicates in alphabetical order.

The "sourceCoordinates" field of the responses:
..................................
The this is a "coords" object (described above under "code") that indicates the
file name and line number of the line that is currently being executed.

Section 2. The API calls
------------------------

createRemoteTM
...............

URL: <BaseURL>/createRemoteTM
Parameters: None
Initial state:  Initially there is no RTM, so there is no initial state.
Action: The server creates a new RTM and assigns it a globally unique identifier.
Final status:  If successful the final state will be NO_EVALUATOR. Otherwise it will be FAILED.
Response:
  status: int         -- This will be NO_EVALUATOR or FAILED.
  guid: string       -- If the status is NO_EVALUATOR, this will be the GUID of the RTM created.
  reason:            -- If the status is NO_EVALUATOR, this will be "".
                        Otherwise, it will be an explanation of the problem.

retireRemoteTM
...............

URL: <BaseURL>/retireRemoteTM
Parameters: 
     guid: string   -- The GUID of the remote TM (returned from a previous createRemoteTM)
Initial state:  Any
Action: The server retires the RTM.
Final status:
   BAD_GUID: if no RTM has ever had the given GUID.
   RETIRED: if the RTM with the GUID has already retired.
   SUCCEEDED: if the RTM was retired.
Response:
  status: int         -- See above created.
  reason:            -- If the status is SUCCEEDED, this will be "".

    language: string -- Either "cpp" or "java"
    fileName: string -- The file name for the main program.
    program: string  --The text of the program.
Initial state:  The RTM may be in any state.
Action:
   Unless the initial state is NO_EVALUATOR, the current evaluator is destroyed.
   The RTM then builds an evaluator and compiles the program.
Final status:
   BAD_GUID: if no RTM has ever had the given GUID
   RETIRED: if the RTM with the GUID has retired
   NO_EVALUATOR: if any error happens prior to compilation.
   DID_NOT_COMPILE: If there was an error during compilation.

Response:
   status:  int  -- see above
   reason: string --  If the status is COMPILED, this will be "".
           Otherwise, a string representing the reason why the status is not COMPILED.
           (e.g. the error message from the compiler). Note that this string may contain
           newline characters.

initializeTheState
...................

URL: <Base URL>/initializeTheState
Parameters:
    guid: string   -- The GUID
    expressionWanted, outputWanted etc -- see the section on State Information.
Initial state:  COMPILED
Action:
   If the RTM is not in the COMPILED state, then the request has no effect.
   If the RTM is in the COMPILED state, then the program is executed until either it can
   not be executed any further, or the first visible expression of the program is about
   to be evaluated.
Final status:
   BAD_GUID: if no RTM has ever had the given GUID.
   RETIRED: if the RTM with the GUID has retired.
   READY: if the RTM is ready for another action.
   EXECUTION_COMPLETE: if the execution of the program is complete
   EXECUTION_FAILED: if there was a failure during execution. For example a run time
   error.
Response:
   status:  int -- see above
   reason: string --  If the status is READY or EXECUTION_COMPLETE, this will be "".
                    Otherwise, a string representing the reason why the status is
                    not READY or EXECUTION_COMPLETE. Note that this string may contain
                    newline characters.
   expression, output, code, etc -- see section on State Information.
   
   
go
..

[Implementation note:  Although this seems very complicated, it is mostly
already implemented inside the current Evaluator class, so don't worry.]

URL: <Base URL>/go
Parameters:
    guid: string   -- The GUID
    commandString: string  -- A string that should follow the following syntax.
        command -->  ws [ simpleCommand ws [ ";" command] ]
        simpleCommand --> [integer ws "*" ws] primaryCommand
        primaryCommand --> "s" | "e" | "o" | "f" | "b" | "m"
        integer -->  digit [ integer ]
        digit --> "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
        ws --> [ " " ws ]
    expressionWanted, outputWanted etc -- see the section on State Information.
Initial state:  Any
Action:
   If the state is not READY, this request does nothing to the state of the RTM.
   If the state is READY and the commandString does not follow the given syntax, the
   result is not defined.
   If the state is READY and the commandString follows the syntax above, then each command
   of the string will be executed in turn as long as the state remains READY.
   Once the state is not READY, the remaining commands have no effect.
   Integers indicate repetition, thus "5*s" is the same as "s;s;s;s;s".
   Primary commands have the following meanings
       s  Step to the next expression, even if it is in a deeper subroutine invocation.
       e  Step to the next expression at an equal or lesser depth.
       o  Step out of the current subroutine invocation.
       f  Step forward to the next operation.
       b  Step until the next break point.
       m  Take a microstep, i.e. the smallest possible advance of the machine's state.
Final status:
   BAD_GUID: if no RTM has ever had the given GUID.
   RETIRED: if the RTM with the GUID has retired.
   READY: if the RTM is ready for another action.
   EXECUTION_COMPLETE: if the execution of the program is complete
   EXECUTION_FAILED: if there was a failure during execution. For example a run time
   error.
   Any other: if the request started in a state that was not READY.
Response:
   status:  int -- see above
   reason: string --  If the final status is READY or EXECUTION_COMPLETE, the
                      reason will be "".
                      If the final status is EXECUTION_FAILED, the reason will
                      be an error message.
                      Otherwise, reason will be a string indicating what the problem is.
   expression, output, code, etc -- see section on State Information.
   
goBack
......

URL: <Base URL>/goBack
Parameters:
    guid: string   -- The GUID
    expressionWanted, outputWanted etc -- see the section on State Information.
Initial state:  ANY
Action:
   The state of the evaluator is backed up to where it was just before
   the most recent checkpoint.   Note that the evaluator can only be
   backed up to the first checkpoint, which happens right after global
   variables are initialized.  After that new checkpoints are created
   at the start of each "go" command.
Final status:
   BAD_GUID: if no RTM has ever had the given GUID.
   RETIRED: if the RTM with the GUID has retired.
   NO_EVALUATOR: if (and only if) the initial state is NO_EVALUATOR
   If there is nothing to undo, the state is unchanged.
   If there was something to undo the final state will be whatever the state
   was before the checkpoint.
Response:
   status:  int -- see above
   reason: string -- If the status is BAD_GUID, RETIRED, or NO_EVALUATOR, a reason why.
                     Otherwise this string should be "".
   expression, output, code, etc -- see section on State Information.
   
redo
....

URL: <Base URL>/redo
Parameters:
    guid: string   -- The GUID
    expressionWanted, outputWanted etc -- see the section on State Information.
Initial state:  ANY
Action:
   The most recent goBack is undone.  If the machine has moved forward since that goBack,
   this request has no effect.
Final status:
   BAD_GUID: if no RTM has ever had the given GUID.
   RETIRED: if the RTM with the GUID has retired.
   NO_EVALUATOR: if (and only if) the initial state is NO_EVALUATOR
   If there is nothing to redo, the state is unchanged.
   If there was something to redo, the final state will be whatever the state
   was before goBack was executed.
Response:
   status:  int -- see above
   reason: string -- If the status is BAD_GUID, RETIRED, or NO_EVALUATOR, a reason why.
                     Otherwise this string should be "".
   expression, output, code, etc -- see section on State Information.
