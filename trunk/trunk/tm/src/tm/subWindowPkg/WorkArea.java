/* Customization of sub-windows is designed to be wholly embodied in this abstract
class. It is not an interface for it provides at least one service to make sure
that all subwindows come into focus properly if they get clicked on while they
are in the background. This can't be done through a interface (as far as I know)
since whatever display is specialized from abstractDisplay must call its corresponding
subWindow whenever the mouse is clicked on it and IT DOES NOT HAVE THE FOCUS. Interfaces
define functions which must be available but the implication is they wait around until
they are called. However, displays must take the initiative and call subWindow when
necessary.

    Given one necessary common service, a convenience common service has also been added.
AbstractDisplay manages the update process using double buffering.

    The SubWindow package has been designed so that each SubWindow has an titleBar and a
workArea. The workArea is where the application specific components are to be added.
Thus the idea is to extend the workArea for each application or each special subwindow,
and not the subWindow. Thus messages from the parent subWindow's toolbar are automatically
routed to the workArea.
2001.11.30: Trying to remove Unix bug that make it impossible to resize windows bigger and
    also move bug that has window move against point where mouse clicked, often to top left
    corner. Struck me that the focus event should not be mousePressed but rather mouseClicked.
    Whether that solves the bug is moot but still true.

2001.01.23: Removed finalize to support rekindling of closed
    windows in the event a new configuration is loaded.
    
99.12.13: Added mutable window titling. The title given at construction is used as an immutable
    name. A separate title can now be specified in the configuration file. Thus, for beginning students
    we might want to use only one store window (the Stack) but label it simply "Memory". Later
    as different types of memory are introduced, we use the more specialised labels.
