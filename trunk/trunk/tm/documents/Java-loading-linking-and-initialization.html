<h1>Java: Loading, linking, and initialization.</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Before a java class or interface can be used for certain things,
it must be loaded, linked, and initialized.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Loaded</dt><dd>In a normal java environment this would mean
  reading the .class file and constructing an object of class <kbd>Class</kbd>
  to represent it internally.
  </dd>
  <dt>Linked</dt><dd>Linking consist of two or three steps
    <dl>
      <dt>Verify</dt><dd>Verification checks the JVM code to ensure that
          it does not violate security restriction.  Verification is not
          relevant to the Teaching Machine.
      </dd>
      <dt>Prepare</dt><dd>Preparation consists of allocating space for
          static fields and initializing them to default values.
      </dd>
      <dt>Resolve (optional)</dt><dd>Resolving consists of replacing
      symbolic references for things (e.g. methods or static fields in other
      classes) with direct references (addresses). This step is
      considered optional and resolution may be delayed until the
      the reference is used.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt>Initialized</dt><dd>Initialization consists of executing
  static variable initializations and code blocks marked static in the
  the class.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>For example. Consider
</p>
<pre>
    class SomeClass {
        static int i = 13;
        static int j ;
        static {
            j = 0 ;
            for(int k=0 ; k &lt; i ; k++ ) {
                    j += k ;}
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>During Preparation i and j are initialized to their default value (zero).
   During Initialization, i is initialized to 13 and j is initialized to 78.
</p>

<h2>Sequencing</h2>
<h3>When initialization takes place</h3>
<p>Initialization of a class or interface T takes place immediately before the
   first occurrence of any of the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>An instance of class T is created.
    <li>A static method of class T is invoked.
    <li>A static field of a class or interface T is assigned.
    <li>A static field of a class or interface T is used (unless the
        field access is a compile time constant expression).
    <li>Certain operations from class <kbd>java.lang.Class</kbd>
        and package <kbd>java.lang.relflect</kbd> cause classes to
        be initialized.
    <li>A direct subclass of a class T is about to be initialized.
</ul>
<p>For example: Consider the following code
</p>
<pre>
    package initialize;
    
    public class Initialize1 extends Super1 implements SomeInterface1 {
        static {
            System.out.println("one"); }
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            int one = SomeInterface1.one ;
            System.out.println("two");
            SomeClass1.x = SomeInterface1.a ;
            System.out.println("five");
        }
        static int init() { System.out.println("three") ; return 0 ; }
    }
    
    class Super1 {
        static {
            System.out.println("zero"); }
    }
        
    
    class SomeClass1 {
        static int x ;
        static {
            System.out.println("four"); }
    }
    
    interface SomeInterface1 {
        static final int one = 1 ;
        static final int a = Initialize1.init() ;
    }
</pre>
<p>It should print out</p>
<pre>
    zero
    one
    two
    three
    four
    five
</pre>
<p>The initialization of <kbd>Initialize1</kbd> is prompted by the call
   to main, but before that can happen <kbd>Super1</kbd> (but not
   <kbd>SomeIterface1</kbd>) is initialized.
   The initialization of <kbd>one</kbd> in main does not cause SomeInterface1 to
   be initialized because <kbd>SomeIterface1.one</kbd> is a compile time constant
   expression.  The reference to <kbd>SomeIterface1.a</kbd> is not a compile time
   constant expression and so it prompts the initialization of <kbd>SomeInterface1</kbd>,
   resulting in <kbd>three</kbd> being printed. The assignment to <kbd>SomeClass1.x</kbd>
   prompts the initialization of <kbd>SomeClass1</kbd>, causing <kbd>four</kbd>
   to be printed.
</p>
<p><em>Aside: The JDK 1.3.1 implementation, at least, also initializes when the
       <kbd>.class</kbd> construct is called. For example
       <kbd>SomeClass1.class</kbd> causes the initialization of <kbd>SomeClass1</kbd>.
       I can't reconcile this behaviour with the standard.
   </em>
</p>

<h3>Loading and Linking</h3>

<p>Loading must precede Linking and Linking must precede Initialization.
   Exactly when loading and linking take place is visible to the
   user in terms of when certain exceptions may be thrown. For example a
   NoClassDefFoundError exception should only occur during loading
   of the class and a VerifyError exception should only be thrown
   during linking.  The system is welcome to actually load and
   link a class earlier than required by the standard as long as
   these exceptions are not thrown until the time when the loading
   or linking "ought" to take place.
</p>
<p>As to exactly when loading and linking ought to take place, I found
   the exact answer to this question difficult to ascertain from either
   the standard or from the jdk compiler.  The following is clear
</p>
   <ul>
       <li>A superclass or superinterface should be loaded before a
           subclass is initialized [loaded?].
       </li>
       <li>A class need not be loaded (and hence linked) until it is
           needed in the code.
       </li>
   </ul>
<p>To illustrate the second point, consider deleting (or corrupting) the
   <kbd>SomeClass1.class</kbd> file before executing the above
   program.  The program prints
</p>
<pre>
    zero
    one
    two
    three
</pre>
<p>before throwing a NoClassDefFoundError (or VerifyError) exception.
</p>

<h2>What to do in the TM</h2>

<p>If we ignore (for now, at least) the exceptions generated
   by loading and linking, we can effectively load and link
   all classes during the fourth pass. (And it should be noted
   that probably none of these exceptions are relevant to the
   Teaching Machine. Most of them are guard against corruption
   of .class files or use of library files incompatible with the
   interfaces that were used during compilation.)
   This means that the static variables can be placed in
   static memory during the fourth pass and initialized
   to default values during the fourth pass.
</p>
<p>For the time being we'll punt on the issue of creating Class 
   objects.  These are really only needed for reflection and
   aren't much good until we support libraries better.
</p>
<p>This means that static variables (datums) can be added into the static
   area of memory and added to the run-time symbol table
   during the fourth pass.
</p>
<p>In C++ chains of initialization statements are added registered with
   the run-time symbol table during compilation and are executed prior
   to calling main (see Cpp.CplusPlusLang.executeInitializations). Each
   chain is in effect a subroutine, ending with a StatReturn node.
   For example a file
</p>
<pre>
        static int i = 12 ;
        static int j = foo() ;
        static int k = 42 ;
</pre>
<p>would result in two initialization chains being created, one for i
   and k and another for initializing j. This is because the C++ standard says that
   the any initialization by a compiler time constant should take place first before
   any other initialization.
</p>
<p>In Java, static variables are initialized to their default values during
   preparation. There are a number of ways to accomplish this.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>One is that whenever a primitive
        Datum is constructed, it is initialized
        to its default value.  This is the approach currently taken.
        It has one major problem: It applies equally to local variables,
        temporary datums (i.e. those in the scratch region),
        instance variables (nonstatic fields), array members, and static variables.
        In reality, we don't want this to happen for local variables
        and it doesn't matter much for temporary variables.
    </li>
    <li>Use static initialization chains, as in C++. These would be executed
        before execution of Main.  This doesn't address the issue of
        default initialization of instance variables and array members.
    </li>
    <li>Define a new method on Datums <kbd>void defaultInitialize()</kbd>.
        This method can be called
        <ul>
            <li>from fourth pass right after the datum is created.
            </li>
            <li>from <kbd>makeMemberDatum</kbd> for in <kbd>TyAbstractClass</kbd>
            </li>
            <li>when datums are added to arrays.
            </li>
        </ul>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>Of these choices, my preference is for the last.
</p>
<p>Initialization of a class has to take place at very specific points
   in the code. These points will be coded into the AST code using a new
   node <kbd>ExpEnsureClassInit</kbd>.  For example an expression
   <kbd>SomeClass.x = 1</kbd> would be coded as
</p>
<pre>
     OpAssign[
         ExpEnsureClassInit[ ExpId( SomeClass.x ) ],
         ConstInt(1) ]
</pre>
<p>The constructor for <kbd>ExpEnsureClassInit</kbd> will include 
   the <kbd>TyObject</kbd> object representing the class.
</p>
<p>Each <kbd>TyObject</kbd> object will have an associated initialization
   subroutine which will contain the static initialization code for the
   class.
</p>
<p>Stepping of <kbd>ExpEnsureClassInit</kbd> will check a flag
   associated with the class. If the flag is false, it is set and
   then the initialization subroutine is entered.
   If the flag is false, stepping is a no-op.
   Since the
   flag is set before the routine is started, code within the
   routine may safely contain <kbd>ExpEnsureClassInit</kbd>
   for the same class.
