<p>Scripting commands for the TM are fairly unwieldy. However, many of them can be buried in function calls. It has proved useful to develop a scripting style to take advantage of this. For example, we normally create a setup() function to handle initialization of a visualizer.</p>
<div id="allExamples">
<!-- The allExamples div is hidden in on-line content and only shows in the printed version of the page. It was intended
for printing out examples in full, where only partial windows into examples are displayed on the browser page. To use
this facility, place an insertCode snippet into this div for each example, setting the selector to "all".
Also, make sure there is a copy of the printForm.htm page in the same folder as this page.-->
