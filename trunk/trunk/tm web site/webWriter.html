   <h2>Introductory Video</h2>
   <p>This is a <a href="premier/ww.htm" target="_top">seven minute introductory video</a> showing
     what webWriter++ can do. It is suggested that the <a href="premier/tm.htm" target="_top">five
     minute introductory video to the Teaching Machine</a> be viewed first. </p>
   <h2>Displaying Code </h2>
     <p>When we went to create our first web pages using the Teaching Machine,
       we quickly discovered that tools were needed to help instructors. One
       of the most difficult problems was displaying code properly. </p>
     <div class="sidebarRight">when instructors focus on content they want the
       technology to just stay out of the way</div>
     Code displays just fine in the Teaching Machine but the TM is an interactive
     tool for students. Sometimes an instructor just wants to display code passively
     and discuss it in the text. A survey of the web as it existed at the time
     (about the year 2000) quickly showed that there was no very satisfactory
     solution out there. Since we had already solved the problem once with the
     TM it seemed only natural to graft that solution onto our web pages.
     <p>While we were at it it seemed reasonable to make the invocation of the
       Teaching Machine as easy as possible. In fact, when instructors focus
       on content they want the technology to just stay out of the way. Thus
       webWriter++ was born.</p>
     <h2>A Tool for Teachers</h2>
     <p>webWriter++ allows instructors to prepare either C++ or Java examples
       in the normal way, in their favourite development environment. By inserting
       a very short snippet of JavaScript, instructors can have their examples
       automatically sucked into their web page and displayed. The following
       features are noteworthy:</p>
     <dl>
       <dt>Color Staining</dt>
       <dd>Keywords, comments and constants are marked and rendered specially.
         The rendering is controlled by a cascading style sheet and may be controlled
         by instructors and made to match the rendering of whatever programming
         environment their students use.</dd>
       <dt>Segmenting</dt>
       <dd>It is often desirable to split even moderate sized examples up into
         pieces for separate discussion. By adding a simple markup to examples,
         instructors can display them in different segments. thus allowing them
         to be discussed separately. All segment, however, come from the same
         file, for easy maintenance. As the markup is buried in comments, it
         does not affect compilation. It is also automatically stripped out before
         rendering on the web page or in the TM and so is invisible to students.</dd>
       <dt>Rollover Markup</dt>
       <dd>Other kinds of markups have also been added. For example, in discussing
         scope an instructor can create code which marks the scope of each variable
         as the mouse hovers over it.</dd>
       <dt>Automatic TM invocation</dt>
       <dd>Buttons can be easily included to invoke the Teaching Machine on the
         example or a video of the instructor running the TM on the example just
         as it was done in class.</dd>
       <dt>Non-Destructive Editing</dt>
       <dd>Students often ask, &quot;What if I changed ... in the code?&quot; An edit button
         can be included which allows an instructor in class (or the student
         later on at home) to change the code and reload it into the TM. The
         changes are dynamic and do not affect the underlying original code.</dd>
     </dl>
     <h3>A Platform for Experimentation </h3>
     <p>Over its few years of existence WebWriter++ has become something of a
       platform for experimentation. At various times we have tried incorporating
       videos, slides and extra notes; we have used pages for tutoring, for lecturing
       and as an electronic textbook. In each case, support has been added to
       WebWriter++. Not all the experiments were successful and a number of experimental
       tools have been dropped. On the other hand tools that worked well have
       been expanded and refined. Some of the more notable&mdash;</p>
     <dl>
       <dt>Print Media Support</dt>
       <dd>Students like to have printed notes. By incorporating print media
         stylesheets and doing a modicum of hand work, we are able to produce
         effective, good looking bound notes. Combining the notes with a CD containing
         the dynamic, Teaching Machine driven, web version creates an effective
         learning resource for students.</dd>
       <dt>TOC Generation</dt>
       <dd>Dynamic Table of Content generation that walks the teaching site,
         generating the Table of Contents on the fly.</dd>
       <dt>Site Dictionary</dt>
       <dd>A dictionary of special terms may be incorporated into the site. Terms
         may be marked on any web page such that hovering over them pops up the
         definition from the dictionary.</dd>
       <dt>Hidden Notes</dt>
       <dd>These can be turned on or off from the navigation bar or activated
         individually using a button.. They are typically used by
         an instructor when reviewing a lecture before it is given then turned
         off during the lecture. They can also be reactivated by students for
         self study.</dd>
       <dt>Switchable Style Modes </dt>
       <dd>The requirements for lecturing and studying are different. A button
         on the navigation bar allows mode switching, changing style sheets as
         well as whether the default for notes is shoing or hidden.</dd>
     </dl>
