/**
 * An iterator class for LinkedDatumDisplay objects. Walks the D3 tree defined
 * by a generator (an arbitrary set of top level datums) where leaves are top
 * level datums and branches are valid (non null) pointers (meaning they are
 * actually connected to datums).
 * 
 * This is distinct from a D3 iterator which walks top level datums internally
 * looking for scalars or unexpanded compounds. Linked D3 iterators make use of
 * D3 iterators to ferret out pointers.
 * 
 * Searching is depth first. See comments under D3 Iterators for discussion of D3
 * pairs and how a D3 tree (of either kind) is walked.
 * 
 * However, the problem is more complex for the linked case. Although the topology
 * of the tree is defined by the datums some work has to be done on the DatumDisplays
 * if new datums are added or their relationship changes (i.e if the topology of the
 * tree changes). This has been dealt with by adding a maintenance mode to iterators.
 * An iterator that is sent out on maintenance rebuilds or renews such topological information
 * as does exist in the DatumDisplay object associated with each datum. For example,
 * creating the DD if it is missing or updating its indirection level.
 * 
 * This is difficult to do as a visitor because the fixups are intimately related to (and
 * distributed throughout) the rather complex iteration process itself. Instead, the tree
 * is treated as if it were a railroad. Walking an iterator over it is akin to running a
 * train - all we are interested in is the stations it has to stop at. Railroad maintenance,
 * however, is more detailed. We are concerned with the condition of the track between the
 * stations. Instead of treating that differently, we do what the old railroads did and send
 * out a maintenance train.
 * 
 * Walking a linked tree is complicated by the fact that the tree can double back on
 * itself. Thus we have be able to tell during the course of an iteration whether a
 * node has already been visited or not. Since our iterations are designed to be one
 * way, the solution used is to stain a node each time we visit it. When the iterator
 * is reset, it picks up a new stain. Thus a visit on a particular pass is easily
 * detected by checking the stain. Of course, there are a finite no. of stains available.
 * Here we use an integer stain. The presumption is that a node cannot keep an old stain
 * long enough to cycle the entire integer set around again.
 * 
 * NOTE: Generators and regions are closely related (indeed, at the moment I think the
 * correct approach to them would be to make region a special class of generator. That is
 * a region is a generator that has the property that its sets of datums span a contiguous
 * address space. Ooops, a datum already has that property so it would be more logical to
 * derive generators FROM regions, loosening the constraint. Unhappily, loosening constraints
 * breaks polymorphism. The looser constraint should always be farther up the tree. Hah! If
 * only mother nature were so neat!) ANYWAY, at the moment, Regions are datums with the special
 * property that their children (the actual datums in the region) don't recognise their parentage.
 * Thus, although we have not quite determined finally the relationship between generators and
 * regions, they are sufficiently close that generators better be consistent with the inconsistency
 * of regions. Thus we need special code at the top level. SI-IIGH! Extra Comment. I have since
 * found this convenient since it conforms to the notion of a top-level datum (i.e., one without
 * a parent). If we were consistent in setting top level datums parent to their region we would
 * require special code to detect a top level datum - namely that one's grandparent was null.
 * 
 * 2007.03.19 Iterator can no longer be put on maintenance. Instead a refresh is called on it,
 * forcing it to do maintenance on the entire tree at once.
