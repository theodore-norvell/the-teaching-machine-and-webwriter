<h1>Tutoring System Wish/Bug List</h1>
<ol>
  <li>It might be nice if rollover markings changed colour in such a way as to 
    contrast best with their original background.</li>

  <li>The objective of moving all webWriter files into the webWriter folder is
    a long way from being met. Currently there are a number of files in the site
    root, vis
    <ol>
      <li>default.htm (or index.htm) has to be there. This is unlikely to change. </li>
      <li>Applets (class and jar
          files) have to be there. Also unlikely to change.</li>
      <li>tocGenerator.htm
          is there. Moving it will affect entire toc generation scheme which
        currently assumes the tocGenerator page is in the root. Difficulty at
        least moderate.</li>
      <li> navBar.htm is there. The ww_one_time script runs off this page and
        that script assumes it's in the root. Changing that may be possible but
        it's complex because content pages contain the webWriter script which
        constantly calls back to the one_time script for navigation information.
        Current approach. Leave it where it is. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
