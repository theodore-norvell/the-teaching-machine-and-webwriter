<h1>Building Teaching Machine Data Visualization Plugins</h1>

<p>Data Visualizaion PlugIns are a specialized version of Display PlugIns</p>
<p>This is a somewhat ammended version of a more general document
  which describes two approaches to developing visualization plugins. For
  the QuizGenerator project, <span style="font-style: italic;">all
  we anticipate needing is the instrumented approach</span>.<br>
  
</p>
<h2><a name="purpose">Purpose</a></h2>

<p>To make the facilities of the Teaching Machine available to
other researchers without
opening up the code base. The alternative is to release the TM as open
source which we are
reluctant to do only because it would turn us into code managers
instead of code developers. Plugins make TM resources freely available
without impairing the integrity of the existing
code base.</p>

<h2><a name="categories">Visualization
Categories</a></h2>

<p> So far we see TM Visualization plugins as being of two types:</p>

<h3>Instrumented</h3>

<p>Simply instrument some data set developed while the
Teaching Machine is running any standard C++ or Java example. The
visualization monitors the data. The changing state of the data as
the TM steps through an example drives the visualization. Instrumented
visualizations can be run with standard examples. &nbsp;As an
example, we are planning to build a bar display that will show an array
of ints as a set of bars of lengths proportional to the int value and
use it to demonstrate sorting algorithms. Such displays are well known.
The point here is to&nbsp;be able to easily integrate such a demo
into the already highly integrated TM /Webwriter++ environment.</p>

<h3>Driven</h3>

<p>These visualizations provide an interface library that is
called from the code example. Thus, unless a parallel visualization
library exists, in the C++ or Java languages, these visualizations will
only run examples written explicitly to work with the library. The
current example of this kind of display is a window to open standard
image files (jpeg, png, etc.) and make them available via a simple
interface as simple 2D arrays of pixels which can be readily
manipulated using standard code. Once the manipulations are performed
the transformed pixels are sent back to the display where they can be
shown. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Comment</h3>

<p>Instrumented visualizations are more general, allowing an
instructor to use any standard example (so long as it can be handled by
the TM in the first place). Instruction driven visualizations are
potentially more powerful. The addition of <a href="../../scripting/package.html">scripting</a>
now allows instructors to
manipulate instrumented visualizations.</p>

<h2><a name="implementation">Implementation</a></h2>

<p>There are three distinct pieces of technology required to
implement
all this. The first is the plug-in system itself. Its role is to allow
a new plug-in (of any kind) to be incorporated into the Teaching
Machine. &nbsp;This means that if the TM is integrated into a
website,
the new plug-in will be incorporated automatically and that it can have
its configuration controlled via the TM's standard configuration
engine. All of this can be accomplished without recompiling the TM or
even having access to its source code. The plug-in system is described
in a <a href="../../plugins/doc-files/Plug-in-system.html">separate
document</a>. The plug-in system has been built and tested.</p>

<p>The second piece is the incorporation of an interface into a
plug-in
to allow it to be made visible to the code as a library. This has been
built and tested for primitive&nbsp;arguments only, using Java
only.
&nbsp;An extension to bridge such an interface over to C++ is
planned
for this year. Extension to structured data is an intermediate priority
and may or may not be accomplished in 2007, depending on demand. <span style="font-style: italic;">This technology is required only
for driven mode and so is not needed for the quizGenerator project.</span></p>

<p>The final requirement was to be able to import data into a
visual
plugin in order that it may be displayed - a selection system. This has
now been <a href="../DataVisualizerAdapter.htm">developed</a>.<br>

</p>

<p>Summarizing, to create an instrumented display one builds a
plug-in and registers it with the TM, then creates a generator by
selecting a desired set of datums to monitor, then lets the evolution
of the datums as the TM runs drive the display.
</p>
<h2><a name="runTime">Run-Time Interface to the TM </a></h2>
<p>The diagram below shows how the plugIn fits into the TM at run-time. The TM follows the classic Model-View pattern with most of the code being either in the model or the view. In the diagram, only those parts of the TM that are relevant to a new <span class="style3">Visualization plugin</span> are shown (<span class="style1">model classes in orange</span>, <span class="style2">view in green</span>).</p>
<p><img src="VisualizerPIInterface.png" width="1216" height="1248">In addition there are a number of <span class="style6">common classes, shown in magenta.</span> In the diagram, <span class="style5">model classes are represented only by <code>TMBigApplet</code></span>, which is the central class in the TM, and <span class="style5">one other block standing in for all other classes</span>. There is a little more detail on the <span class="style3">view side</span> as that's where the new display is to plug in. Even so, only those classes directly related to it are shown. To see how plugins are created, see the next section.</p>
<h3><a name="displaySide">Display Side</a></h3>
<p>Every display in the TM is derived from the class <code>WorkArea</code> and each <code>WorkArea</code> object has a related <code>SubWindow</code> object which is a kind of <code>JInternalFrame</code>. <code>SubWindows</code> are just that, visible windows that are restricted to operate within the main TM window. Each has a single <code>WorkArea</code> which is basically a single scrollPane where the drawing gets done. (Although logically it would seem that <code>SubWindows</code> have <code>WorkAreas</code>, the two are actually in a one-to-one relationship. From the point-of-view of displays it is more convenient to think of <code>WorkAreas</code> as having a <code>SubWindow</code> in which they are contained.)</p>
<p>A special abstract <code>DataVisualizerAdapter</code> class has been created to provide</p>
<ol>
  <li>A set of common services needed by all visualizers (declared final in the code). </li>
  <li>Default versions of functions which are needed in some cases (such as <code>winnow()</code>, which provides a filtering service) but which may be over-ridden.</li>
  <li>The abstract <code>drawArea</code> method which must be provided by visualizers to create the actual visualization.</li>
</ol>
<p>New visualizer plugins should be derived from the <code>DataVisualizerAdapter</code> class. </p>
<p>The <code>DisplayManager</code> is itself a plugin. Effectively, it plugs into the <code>TMBigApplet</code> and all the displays plugin to it. This is to allow a different <code>DisplayManger</code> to be plugged in with perhaps quite different layout stategies. Because of this layered communications, it has separate top and bottom interfaces, each of which defines a two way flow. Its interface to the displays is known as a <code>DisplayContextInterface</code> because the <code>DisplayManager</code> provides the context for the displays. In turn the displays are defined by a <code>DisplayInterface</code>. Notice that across these two, command flow only goes one way, from <code>DisplayManager</code> to <code>Display</code>. The context only provides query  callbacks.</p>
<h3><a name="modelSide">Model Side</a></h3>
<p>From the point of view of the <code>quizGenerator</code>, classes on the model side read in the source files containing examples to be run in the TM. The TM compiles the examples and then runs them. Normally running is controlled by mouse clicks but a new set of comands are being added to the <a href="../../interfaces/ExternalCommandInterface.html" target="_top"><code>ExternalCommand</code> interface</a> to support autorunning which the <code>quizGenerator</code> needs.</p>
<p>Commands for the <code>TMBigApplet</code> can come from the GUI (mouse clicks and menus), from <span class="WW">WebWriter</span> (that is from JavaScript calls) or from the <code>ScriptManager</code>. The <code>TMBigApplet</code> may mediate the command streams (for example, preventing commands from the GUI while autorunning, except for stopping or rate setting).</p>
<h3><a name="commonClasses">Common Classes</a></h3>
<p>Most interfaces in the TM are kept in a special Interfaces package, are public and thus available throughout the entire system. The <a href="../../scripting/ScriptManager.htm"><code>ScriptManager</code></a> is a Singleton class, also available universally, as it is potentially able to script any part of the TM (presuming it makes sense to do so). </p>
<h2><a name="creation">Creation (PlugIn) Interface to the TM</a></h2>
<p>The plugin systen allows new modules to be added to the TM without recompiling the TM. Indeed, the only thing required is the tm.jar file. The disgram below shows the relevant classes and interfaces to developers of DataVisualization plugins at creation time.</p>
<p><img src="VisualizerPICreation.png" width="1168" height="825"> </p>
<p>Colour coding is the same as in the run-time diagram. Each plugIn in the TM has an associated plugInFactory object which exists soley to create that kind of plugIn. Thus the CodeDisplayPIFactory creates the CodeDisplay and the StoreDisplayPIFactory creates the four store display objects. Similarly a new visualizer requires an associated new visualizer factory as well. Even the DisplayManager is a plugIn, allowing us to substitute different display managers in the future or even choose between different ones.</p>
<p>It is recommended (though not mandatory) that new Visualizer plugIns specialize the DataVisualizerAdapter which provides a number of services common to any data visualizer (such as how to create the generator - the set of datums to be visualized). </p>
