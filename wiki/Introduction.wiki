This is the home --at least for now-- for a number of projects developed at Memorial University for teaching programming and other purposes.
   * The Teaching Machine -- a program animation and algorithm  animation system for Java and C++
   * WebWriter++ -- A JavaScript based system for preparing course sites and lecture notes.
   * JHigraph -- A Java library for presenting and interacting with hierarchical graphs.

Downloads  of the Teaching Machine and WebWriter++, along with several course sites that use both the Teachin Machine and WebWriter++, are at http://www.teachingmachine.org/
