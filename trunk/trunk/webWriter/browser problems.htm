<h1>Browser Problems with WebWriter++</h1>
<p>My current version of Explorer on my computer can't render 3891 lectures properly
  when they are on the web. Renders them locally, ok. JavaScript error is: Line
  480. Object doesn't support this property or method. Problem is in <code>webWriter.js</code>,
  and appears to be actually line 479 (IE reports line numbers 1 different than
  dreamwaever)</p>
<p><code>var stainedCode = parseApplet.markUpString(rawCode, relativeURL);</code></p>
<p><code>parseApplet</code> is actually in the <code>markUp.jar</code> file. We changed the
  syntax of the call a few months ago but the local and web files have been synchronized
  many times since and, in particular, both <code>markUp.jar</code> and <code>webWriter.js</code> are the
  same. </p>
<p>I'm using Explorer X6.0.2800.1106 xpsp2.021108-1929. Microsoft VM is enabled
  with Java Console &amp; Java logging enabled but not the JIT. The problem only
  showed up after I did an update of XP to service pack 2. I subsequently undid
  the update but, as is apparent from the explorer version no., not everything
  got undone. Lest that was the problem, I re-installed sp2. The problem persists.</p>
<p>The Java Console shows</p>
<p><code>java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: MarkUp<br>
at com/ms/vm/loader/URLClassLoader.loadClass<br>
at com/ms/vm/loader/URLClassLoader.loadClass<br>
at com/ms/applet/AppletPanel.securedClassLoad<br>
at com/ms/applet/AppletPanel.processSentEvent<br>
at com/ms/applet/AppletPanel.processSentEvent<br>
at com/ms/applet/AppletPanel.run<br>
at java/lang/Thread.run</code></p>
<p>Explorer's settings under sp2 are quite different so I tried changing many
  of those that seemed apposite. One real annoyance is that MS is lumping JavaScripts
  and X-controls  together. Nevertheless, local files are read without problem
  so all the capabilities are there (and turned on). When explorer finds what
  it regards as a security problem it normally tells you. Still, it could be
  some security protocol applied to the net but not locally.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when trying to open the 3891 lecture site locally, Explorer
  blocks the site. It doesn't do that when I access it over the internet, another
  sign the zones are set differently.</p>
<p>So, try adding the 3891 lecture site to trusted sites - </p>
