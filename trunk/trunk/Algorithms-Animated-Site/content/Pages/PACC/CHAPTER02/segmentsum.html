<title>The segment sum problem</title>

<body>

<p>In order to explain the basic principles of algorithm design and complexity
analysis, let us consider a "toy" problem, that is, searching for a <em>segment
with maximum sum</em>. Given a sequence of $n$ integers stored into an
array $a$, a <b>segment</b> is any subsequence of consecutive elements $a_i,
a_{i+1}, \ldots, a_j$, from position $i$ to position $j$. We will denote this
segment by $a[i, j]$, where $0 \leq i \leq j \leq n-1$ (hence, the entire array
corresponds to $a[0,n-1]$). The <em>sum</em> of segment $a[i, j]$ is equal to
the sum of its components: $sum(a[i, j]) = \sum_{k=i}^j a[k]$. Our problem
consists in looking for the segment with maximum sum (if two segments have the
same sum, then the shorter one is better). Clearly, the problem is interesting
only if the sequence contains negative elements (otherwise the best solution is
always the entire array). </p>

<p>The simplest solution for this problem consists of analysing all possible
segments and to select the one with the maximum sum. This can be done by
generating all pairs of indices $i$ and $j$ with $0 \leq i \leq j \leq n-1$ e by
computing the corresponding sums. The computational cost of this solution is
$O(n^3)$ time: indeed, we need two loops (one nested into the other) in order to
generate all pairs of indices $i$ and $j$ and one loop nested into the inner one
whose body is executed $j-i+1$ times. Observe that the spatial complexity of the
algorithm is $O(1)$ since we just use a constant number of additional variables
(besides the input array).</p>

<p>A better solution is based on the fact that $sum(a[i, j]) = sum(a[i, j-1]) +
a[j]$: hence, we don't need to start again in order to compute $sum(a[i, j])$
since we can use the previously computed value $sum(a[i, j-1])$. The
computational cost of this new solution is $O(n^2)$ time and $O(1)$ space.</p>

<p>The optimal solution takes advantage of the combinatorial structure of the
problem, since the number of possible segments of maximum sum is linear and
since these segments have to be disjoint as a consequence of the following
properties. Let $a[i, j]$ be a segment of maximum sum and of shortest length
among the ones with the same sum: then the following holds.</p>

<ol> <li>Any prefix of $a[i,j]$ has positive sum: $sum(a[i, k]) > 0$ for any $i
\leq k < j$. Otherwise, there exists $k$ such that \[sum(a[i, j]) = sum(a[i, k])
+ sum(a[k+1, j]) \leq sum(a[k+1, j]).\] That is, $a[k+1, j]$ has a sum greater
than $a[i, j]$ or it has equal sum but it is shorter: this contradicts the
optimality of $a[i,j]$.</li>
  
<li>$a[i,j]$ cannot be extended on the left: $sum(a[k, i-1]) \leq 0$ for any $0
\leq k \leq i-1$. Otherwise there exits $k \leq i-1$ such that \[sum(a[k, j]) =
sum(a[k, i-1]) + sum(a[i, j]) > sum(a[i, j]).\] That is, $a[k, j]$ has a sum
greater than $a[i, j]$: this contradicts the optimality of $a[i,j]$.</li> </ol>

<p>We can take advantage of these two properties while scanning the array $a$,
as shown in the following code.</p>

  insertCode("pacc/chapter02/SegmentSum.java", true, "code", "segmentsum.tmcfg",
  "ww", "tm&!S");
</script> </p> <h2>Complexity analysis</h2> <p>The complexity of this algorithm
is $O(n)$ time (we have one loop whose body requires constant time) and $O(1)$
space (we use a constant number of additional variables). This complexity is
clearly optimal.</p>
