<h1>Unqualified lookup.</h1>





<p>Un-qualified lookup of a simple name in a given scopeholder should return 
the set of all declarations that have that simple name as their terminal-id
that are "visible" (6.3.1) in that scope-holder. that is to say the declaration
is "in scope" (6.3) in that scopeholder, but that are not "shadowed" (6.3.1).
This may include some declarations that are "inherited" (6.4) from a supertype.<br>
</p>




<p>Names are classified as one of the following syntactic categories [Note.
I think I need to rewrite the parser to make names easier to extract. Currently
names come from the parser in three forms:<br>
</p>




<ul>




  <li>As the ScopedName attribute of a. node. These are all easily classified and the classification is now proberly documented.</li>
  <li>As the type name in the SpecifierSet attribute of a node. These are all TypeNames.</li>
  <li>Using the JJTDOT node. These I want to look-at again. Maybe I can can
get these all to change to one of the other two forms. This is a fourth pass
issue.<br>
  </li>
</ul>




] We should probably have a lookup flag (or set of flags) for each of these categories
<ul>




  <li>PackageName</li>
  <li>TypeName</li>
  <li>ExpressionName [I think
this one should actually correspond to a set of flags encompasing all variables,
be they fields, parameters, or local variables]</li>
  <li>MethodName</li>
  <li>PackageOrTypeName</li>
  <li>AmbiguousName</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition, there are some other things that have to be looked up<br>
</p>



<ul>



  <li>labels</li>
  <li>fields</li>
  <li>parameters</li>
  <li>local variables</li><li>[others?]<br>
  </li>

</ul>




<h2>PackageName</h2>




<p>The JLS assumes a non-flat model for packages. This creates a bit of a
problem for package names. We can either work around the problem, or go to
a non-flat model for representing packages. [TBD]<br>
</p>




<h2>TypeName</h2>




<p>Inherited type names can be shadowed by noninherited scope names.<br>
</p>


<p>The following is based on (6.5.5).<br>
</p>




<p>Default lookup implementation:</p>




<ul>




  <li>Look in the current scope for a type with this name</li>
  
  <ul>
    <li>If &nbsp;one is found return it</li>
  </ul>

  
  <ul>
    <li>If more than one found, return error.<br>
  </li>
  </ul>

  <li>Look in the enclosing scope (if there is one)</li>
  
  <ul>
    <li>If one is found, return it</li>
    <li>otherwise return error.</li>
  </ul>

</ul>



For TypeSH this is modified to account for inheritence and hiding.<br>



<ul>



  <li>Look in the current scope for a type with this name</li>
<ul><li>If &nbsp;one is found return it</li></ul><ul><li>If more than one found, return error.<br>
  </li></ul><li>Look in all supertypes unioning the results.</li><ul><li>If one is found return it</li></ul><ul><li>If more than one found, return error</li></ul><li>Look in the enclosing scope</li><ul><li>If one is found, return it</li><li>otherwise return error.</li></ul>
</ul>





    
For compilation unit scope holders, the basic algorithm is modified to handle imports<br>


<ul>


<li>Look in the current scope for the a type with this name</li><ul><li>If &nbsp;one is found return it</li></ul><ul><li>If more than one found, return error.<br>
  </li></ul><li>If there is an "single-type-import" declaration for the type</li><ul><li>return the declaration of the imported class<br>
</li></ul><li>Look in the enclosing scope (which will be the package)</li>
  <ul>
<li>If one is found, return it</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Look in all packages and classes that are mentioned in "import-on-demand" declarations</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If one is found, return it</li>
    <li>If more than one is found, return error</li>
    <li>If none are found, return&nbsp; error<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>




    
<h2>ExpressionName</h2>





    
<p>ExpressionNames are used for a number of things. &nbsp;Typical use is
to access variables. Thus when the name is "simple" it usually referres to
some field, parameter, or local variable. The look up rules are quite similar
to those for types. The difference is that for variables, we don't chase
imports, so there are no special considerations rule for compilation units.<br>
</p>


<p>This is based on (6.5.6)<br>
</p>


<p>
    </p>





    
<p>Default lookup implementation:</p>





<ul>


<li>Look in the current scope for a local variable, parameter, or field with this name</li><ul><li>If &nbsp;one is found return it</li></ul><ul><li>If more than one found, return error.<br>
  </li></ul><li>Look in the enclosing scope (if there is one)</li><ul><li>If one is found, return it</li><li>otherwise return error.</li></ul>
</ul>




For TypeSH this is modified to account for inheritence and hiding.<br>




<ul>


<li>Look in the current scope for a local variable, parameter, or field with this name</li><ul><li>If &nbsp;one is found return it</li></ul><ul><li>If more than one found, return error.<br>
  </li></ul><li>Look in all supertypes unioning the results.</li><ul><li>If one is found return it</li></ul><ul><li>If more than one found, return error</li></ul><li>Look in the enclosing scope</li><ul><li>If one is found, return it</li><li>otherwise return error.</li></ul>
</ul>





    
<ul>


<ul>
  </ul>

</ul>




<h2>MethodName</h2>


Method names are similar to field names except: It is not an error to find
multiple names, methods declared in subclasses do not shadow methods found
in super classes<br>


<p>Default lookup implementation:</p>






<ul>


<li>Look in the current scope for a method with this name</li><ul><li>if 1 or more were found, return them<br>
</li></ul><li>Look in the enclosing scope (if there is one)</li><ul><li>If one is found, return it</li><li>otherwise return error.</li></ul>
</ul>





For TypeSH this is modified to account for inheritence<br>





<ul>


<li>Create a declaration set ds, initially empty<br>
</li><li>Look in the current scope for a method with this name</li>
<ul><li>Add all found to ds</li></ul><li>Look in all supertypes unioning the results.</li><ul><li>Add all found to ds</li><li>If ds is now nonempty, return it</li>
</ul><li>Look in the enclosing scope</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If one is found, return it</li>
    <li>otherwise return error.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>


<h2>PackageOrTypeName</h2>


<p>The TypeName interpretation is preferred. See (6.5.4)</p>


<p>Lookup for PackageOrTypeName<br>
</p>


<ul>


  <li>Recursively look for the name as a TypeName</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If result is not error, then return it</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Recursively look for the name as a PackageName</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If any found, return it</li>
    <li>Otherwise, return error</li>
  </ul>
</ul>


<h2>AmbiguousName</h2>


<p>Basically the disambiguation rules say that fields, types, and packages
are preferred in that order. The rules are rather complicated, but I think
that this is all they add up to.<br>
</p>


<p>Lookup for AmbiguousName<br>
</p>



<ul>


<li>Recursively look for the name as an ExpressionName</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If result is not error, then return it<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Recursively look for the name as a TypeName</li>
<ul><li>If result is not error, then return it</li></ul><li>Recursively look for the name as a PackageName</li><ul><li>If any found, return it</li><li>Otherwise, return error</li></ul>
</ul>


<h2>Labels<br>
</h2>


The basic lookup algorithm should suffice<br>


<p>Default lookup implementation:</p>







<ul>


<li>Look in the current scope for a label with this name</li><ul><li>if 1 or more were found, return them<br>
</li></ul><li>Look in the enclosing scope (if there is one)</li><ul><li>If one is found, return it</li><li>otherwise error</li></ul>
</ul>


<h2>Member lookup</h2>


<p>I'm not sure how this fits into the CLC scheme of lookup routines, but
sometimes you want to look for something you know is a member. That is you
don't want to look in the enclosing scopes of a class. For example:
</p>

<pre>class A {<br>   class B {<br>   }<br>   class C {<br>   }<br>   void m() {<br>      C.B x; // Not allowed<br>   }<br>}<br></pre>


<p>Doing a regular lookup of B in the scope-holder for C would find B, but in fact it should not be found.<br>
</p>


<p>However, member lookup must find members that are inherited and not shadowed.<br>
</p>

<p>Similarly we need a member lookup on packages and perhaps compilation units.<br>
</p>


<h1>Qualified Lookup</h1>


In the following I'll assume that the qualified name is of the form Q.I where I is a simple name.<br>


<h2>PackageName</h2>
<p>Q must be a package name<br>
</p>

<ul>

  <li>Lookup a package named Q</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If result is error then return error</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Do a member lookup on the package for I

  </li>
</ul>

<ul>

</ul>
<h2>TypeName</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lookup a PackageOrTypeName named Q</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Result is error, return error</li>
    <li>If type found, search for a member type named I</li>
    <li>If a package found, search for a member type named I</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>TypeOrPackageName</h2>

<ul>
<li>Lookup a PackageOrTypeName named Q</li><ul><li>If result is error, return error</li><li>If type found, search it for a member type named I</li><li>If a package found, search it for a member type named I</li>
    <ul>
      <li>If none found, search it for a member package named I<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>ExpressionName</h2>
[This is a tough one and you are right, accessabilty come into play here.
Yikes. I'm out of time, so I'm going to leave this one for later]
<ul>
  <ul>
<ul><li><br>
</li></ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>MethodName</h2>
<p>Q can be assumed to be an AmbiguousName<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lookup an AmbiguousName Q</li>
  <li>If error returned, return error</li>
  <li>If a package found, return error</li>
  <li>If a type found, search the type for a member method I</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If none found, return error</li>
    <li>If the method is nonstatic, then return error</li>
    <li>Else return the method(s)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>If an ExpressionName found, let T be the type of the expression</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Search T for a member method I</li>
    <ul>
      <li>If none found, return error</li>
      <li>Else return the method(s)</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>AmbiguousName</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Lookup Q as an AmbiguousName</li>
  <li>If error returned, return error</li>
  <li>If a package returned</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Look for a member type I in the package</li>
    <ul>
      <li>If one found, return it</li>
      <li>Else lookup Q.I as a PackageName; return the result</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Else if a type found</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Look for a member method (!) or field I in the type</li>
    <ul>
      <li>If any found, lookup Q.I as an ExpressionName; return the result</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Else</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Look for a member type I of &nbsp;the type</li>
        <li>If one found, return that type</li>
        <li>Else return error<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Else if an ExpressionName found</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Let T be the type of the ExpressionName.</li>
    <li>Look for a member method (!) or field I in the type</li>
    <ul>
<li>If any found, lookup Q.I as an ExpressionName; return the result</li>

      </li></ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>






<h1>Glossary</h1>





<ul>





  <li>"in scope" (6.3) A declarataion is in scope if it can be referred to by a simple name, or would be if it weren't shadowed.</li>
  <li>"shadowed" (6.3.1) A declaration is shadowed if there is a conflicting declaration in an enclosed scope. For example
    <pre>class A {<br>   interface T { }<br>   void m() {}<br>   int f<br>   class B { <br>      class T {<br>         void m(int i) {<br>            float f ;<br>            // at this point the outer declarations of<br>            // T, f, and m are shadowed by the enclosed<br>            // declarations.<br>         } } } }</pre>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>"shadowed" is distinct from "obscured" and "hidden".</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Only types can shadow types, only fields can shodow fields, only methods can shadow methods.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>While types and fields shadow types and fields declared in supertypes, methods do not.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
<li>"inherited" (6.4). Members other than private members, "overridden" members 
and "implemented" members are inherited. This means that protected members 
are inhertited even if there are weird rules that make them inaccessible.
Knowing whether a method is overridden or implemented, might be a bit tricky.</li><li>"simple name". A name with no dots.<br>
</li>
