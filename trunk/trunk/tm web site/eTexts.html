     <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>These are the actual, interactive,
       web-based eNotes for two of our C++ courses. They have been developed
       over many years and subjected to extensive student testing. What are published here are reference versions, stripped of their  Memorial local information (like course numbers). Otherwise, they are as taught in Memorial`s Faculty of Engineering in 2009 and 2010.</p>
     <p>They are offered under a Creative Commons Non-Commercial license (which basically means they're free to anyone who is not trying to make money off them).</p>
     <h2>Who should be interested?</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Students studying C++</li>
       <li>Instructors teaching introductory or advanced programming</li>
    </ul>
     <h2>Features</h2>
     <p>A complete text for a year long course in C++, broken into two parts, which demonstrates virtually every technique we have found
  for using webWriter++ and the TM. In particular</p>
<ol>
       <li>Code samples are created normally in a program editor. They are displayed
         in the notes inside code boxes with the following special features:
         <ol>
           <li>The appearance of the code is controlled by a cascading style
             sheet so that instructors can match it to how code appears in the
             student's own code editors.</li>
           <li>A simple markup system allows instructors
               to tag the code so that only the portion to be discussed is displayed
             on the web page.</li>
           <li>Buttons can be added to the box to run the code in the TM, edit
             the code (non-destructively) or run a video about the code.</li>
         </ol>
       </li>
       <li> Table of Contents is generated dynamically so changes to the lectures
         are reflected at once in the TOC</li>
       <li>Hidden notes can be added, for example to explain in detail how students
         should run a sample in the TM themselves. The notes can be revealed
         at the press of a button.</li>
       <li>A course dictionary can be activated to allow definitions to be shown
         as popups whenever a key word is rolled over with the mouse.</li>
       <li>A print button allows students to create printable pages suitable
         for printed notes. In addition to appropriate formatting, the printable
         page shows a hidden container at the end of each lecture containing
         all examples in full. Currently, instructors must populate this container
         manually. </li>
     </ol>
     <h2>Courses</h2>
     <p>Course decriptions are as originally displayed on our own web pages and
       reflect the original calendar descriptions in the Memorial University
       calendar. (Any mistakes are ours, and not Memorial's).</p>
    <p>Please note the following caveats:</p>
  <ol>
       <li>The courses are all taught in C++, so examples and teaching are oriented
         to C++.</li>
       <li>The pages are tested agaianst Firefox. As far as we know they work
         in Explorer and Safari but we don't test against them.</li>
       <li>The Java Runtime Engine must be loaded on your computer and Java must
         be enabled on your browser.</li>
       <li>Courses display reasonably on a MAC when run from a server. If you
         download a course and try to run it from a MAC locally it will complain
         about security exceptions. </li>
