To install the TM plug-in for Eclipse:
  (0) Shutdown any running eclipse processes.
  (1) Find your Eclipse plug-ins directory.
      On MS Windows this is typically called
      C:\Program Files\eclipse\plugins
      On a Mac it may be called /Installed-software/eclipse/plugins
  (3) Delete any files in your Eclipse plug-ins directory with names matching
      tmEclipsePlugIn*.jar or TeachingMachinePlugin*.jar.
  (4) Move the file TeachingMachinePlugIn2_2013.0.0.a.jar from
      the installation directory to your Eclipse plug-ins directory.
  (5) Start-up Eclipse.

Using the TM plug-in for Eclipse:

   * When you are editing a .java or a .cpp file you should
     be able to send this file to the Teaching Machine
     by clicking on the Teaching Machine Icon on the Eclipse
     toolbar. But, you should save the file first!
     
   * Alternatively, in Eclipse's Package Explorer view or
     Navigator view, right click on a .java or .cpp file
     and select Teaching Machine/Send to Teaching Machine.
     Save the file first, though.

We've recently tested the plug-in on the Juno version of Eclipse.
