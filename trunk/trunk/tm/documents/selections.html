<h1>Proposal for a source line interface</h1>

<h2>Current state</h2>

<p>Currently the Interfaces.EvaluatorInterface
specifies the following 3 routines for obtaining
source line.
</p>
<pre>
    public int getCodeFocus() ;    // Indexed from 0
    public String getCodeLine(int l); // Indexed from 0.
    public int getNumCodeLines() ;
</pre>

<p> Currently the String returned is encoded with a system of special
characters for colour staining.  The problem with this is that
if these characters appear in a Java program they will not appear correctly.
</p>

<p>Other problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Only supports one file
  <li>String is not as efficient as char[]
  <li>The String contains mark-up instructions, this makes
    it more complicated to deal with tab expansion on the view
    side (currently tab expansion is handled at parse time)
    and makes it more complex to deal with files that might happen
    to use the same characters that we are using for mark-up.
  <li>no support for selections (invisible lines and characters).
  <li>no support for other pedagogical mark-up.
</ul>

<h2>New Proposal</h2>

<P>For multiple files, I propose the following should be
in the EvaluatorInterface.
</P>

<pre>  
    public SourceCoords getCodeFocus() ;

    /** @precond  ch is an ascci letter || ch==DEFAULT_SELECTION || ch==COMPLETE_SELECTION */
    public void setSelection( char ch ) ;
    
    public char getSelection() ; // Default is DEFAULT_SELECTION
    
    static final char DEFAULT_SELECTION = (char)123 ;
    
    static final char COMPLETE_SELECTION =(char)124 ;
    
    public int toSelectedCodeLineIndex( SourceCoords coords ) ;
    
    public int getNumSelectedCodeLines( TMFile tmFile ) ;
    
    /** @precond 0 &lt;= index &amp;&amp; index &lt; getNumSelectedCodeLines( tmFile ) */
    public CodeLine getSelectedCodeLine( TMFile tmFile, int index ) ;
</pre>

<P>getCodeFocus returns the coordinates of the current code focus,
that is the line the machine is currently being executed or about to execute.
Ordinarily this line is selected, but it may not be.
</P>

<P>set- and getSelection set and get the current selection character.
The special character  DEFAULT_SELECTION  shows all parts of the
code that are not hidden using /*#H*/. COMPLETE_SELECTION shows
all code, even if it is hidden using /*#H*/.
</P>

<P> toSelectedCodeLineIndex(sc) maps a source coordinate to an index
greater than or equal to 0 and less than <i>or equal</i> to
getNumSelectedCodeLines( sc.getFile() ).
If the line corresponding to the source coordinates is selected 
(that is, any of its text is selected) then the index returned
is the index of the same line, otherwise it returns the index of
the next line that is selected, if no such line exists, it
returns getNumSelectedCodeLines( sc.getFile() ).</P>

<P>getNumSelectedCodeLines returns the number of selected lines in the
given file. Could be 0.</P>

<P>getSelectedCodeLine returns information about a particular selected line
in the given file in the form of a CodeLine object.
</P>

<p>CodeLine is a class that contains methods</p>
<pre>
   char [] getChars() ;
   SourceCoords getCoords() ;
   MarkUp [] markUp() ;
</pre>

<p>The getChars routine returns the characters for the line. Tab characters
are not expanded.  Characters may have any unicode encoding at all, there
are no restrictions.</P>

<P>The getCoords routine returns the source coordinates for the line.
This should be used for numbering</P>

<P>The markUp array consists of Objects of type MarkUp with fields</P>
<pre>
    short column ;
    short command ;
</pre>
<P>The column numbers are indices into the getChars() array and the
the command goes into effect when the column is reached.
Commands are
</P>
<UL>
     <LI>NORMAL = 0       -- change font to normal font
     <LI>KEYWORD = 1      -- change font to keyword font
     <LI>COMMENT = 2      -- change font to comment
     <LI>PREPROCESSOR = 3 -- change font to preprocessor font
     <LI>CONSTANT = 6     -- change font to constant font
     <LI>HIDE_ALL = 10     -- hide subsequent characters
     <LI>DISPLAY_ALL = 11  -- display subsequnent characters
     <LI>HIDE_SELECTION = 128  -- hide subsequent characters if current selection character is command - HIDE_WINDOW
     <LI>DISPLAY_SELECTION = 256 -- display subsequent characters if current selection character is is command - DISPLAY_WINDOW
</UL>

<P>The HIDE and DISPLAY commands can be used to turn on and off a display_flag
as follows.  At the start of each line, display_flag should be set to true.
When a command goes into effect, we execute
</P>
<pre>
    if( command == HIDE_ALL )
        display_flag = commandProcessor.getDisplayAll() ;
    else if( command == DISPLAY_ALL ) display_flag = true ;
    else if( HIDE_WINDOW &lt;= command &amp;&amp; command &lt; HIDE_WINDOW+128 ) {
        char win = commandProcessor.getWindow() ;
        if( win != '\uffff' &amp;&amp; (char)(command-HIDE_WINDOW) == win )
            display_flag = commandProcessor.getDisplayAll() ; }
    else if( DISPLAY_WINDOW &lt;= command &amp;&amp; command &lt; DISPLAY_WINDOW+128 ) {
        char current = commandProcessor.getWindow() ;
        if( win != '\uffff' &amp;&amp; (char)(command-DISPLAY_WINDOW) == win )
            display_flag = true ; }
</pre>

<p>Each line is self-contained in the sense that its display commands are
independent of any commands associated with earlier lines.  For example
if we have</P>
<pre>
/*#H*//*#DA*/int main() {
  cout << "hello world" ; }
</pre>

<p>Then the second line would have a command array of</P>
<PRE>
  (0, HIDE_ALL), (0, DISPLAY_WINDOW+65), (10, CONSTANT), (23, NORMAL)
</PRE>

<P>Comments on this design.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The knowledge of which windows are visible
is contained on the interpreter side, not the display side. This
is appropriate because the interpreter does not stop on lines that
are entirely invisible.
  <LI>A cleaner interface would not need to have commands for turning
on and off display, instead, invisible characters can just be omitted from
the array of characters.  The more complex interface that I've chosen
allows the interpreter to build the character and command arrays
just once.  This is a matter of efficiency.
