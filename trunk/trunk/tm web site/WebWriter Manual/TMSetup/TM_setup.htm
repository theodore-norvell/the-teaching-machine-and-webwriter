  <h2>Supported browsers</h2>
<p>We test web pages on recent versions of </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Firefox (Windows and Macintosh)</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer (Windows)</li>
    <li>Safari (Macintosh and iPad)</li>
    <li>Chrome (Windows and Android)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The lecture notes should be viewable on any standards compliant web browser. The code examples can be run on browsers that have a Java plugin.</p>
<h2>Getting your computer ready</h2>
<h3>1. Install a good browser</h3>
<p>We recommend the most recent version of Firefox (for desktop/laptop Windows, Linux, and Mac), Chrome or Dolphin (for Android), Safari (for iPads or Mac), or IE (for Windows RT).</p>
<p>Note: for security, it is important to keep your browser up to date.</p>
<h3>2. Install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Java Platform Plugin.</h3>
<p>This step only applies to Windows (but not Windows RT), Mac, and Linux (but not Android). Currently iOS, Android, Windows RT do not support the JRE.</p>
<p>First <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp" target="_new">check whether you already have an up-to-date Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java Platform Plugin</a>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If your JRE is up to date,  go to the next step</li>
    <li>If your JRE is out of date, upgrade. Then go to the next step.</li>
    <li>If you  no JRE was detected, follow <a href="http://www.java.com/inc/BrowserRedirect1.jsp" target="_top">this link</a> to install it. Then go to the next step.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: for security, it is important to keep your JRE up to date.</p>
  <h3><a name="unblock"></a>3. Allow the Teaching Machine to run in your browser.</h3>
  <p>This step only applies if you have a  Java Platform Plugin. (See previous step.)</p>
  <p>If your browser reports that it has blocked the Teaching Machine application from running, you need to follow this step. In this case you will see a warning window that looks  like this when viewing the site. Note the location.</p>
<p><img src="ApplicationBlocked.png" width="523" height="236" alt="Dialog showing application blocked."></p>
  <p>To unblock the Teaching Machine.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the Java Control Panel.    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>In Windows 7 this is done by Start &gt;&gt; Control Panel &gt;&gt; Programs &gt;&gt; Java.</li>
      <li>On Mac OS X, this is done by clicking on the Apple symbol at the top left of the screen, selecting &quot;System Preferences ...&quot;, and then selecting &quot;Java&quot; in the &quot;Other&quot; sections.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Add the location from the Application Blocked window (&quot;http://www.engr.mun.ca&quot; in the picture above) to the &quot;Exception Site List&quot; on the &quot;Security&quot; tab. See the following picture.</li>
  </ol>
<p><img src="ExceptionSiteList.png" width="530" height="570" alt="Picture of the security tab of the Java Control Panel showing &quot;http://www.engr.mun.ca&quot; added to the site exception list."></p>
  <p>You should then reload the WebWriter++ site.</p>
  <p>You will  be given a security prompt (&quot;An unsigned application is requesting permission to run.&quot;) each time the applet starts. You can then click on &quot;Run&quot;. The Teaching Machine contains no malicious code and is run in a sandbox.</p>
  <h3>4. Install the Teaching Machine application and the Teaching Machine Eclipse plugin.</h3>
  <p>This step is optional. It will make it easier to run your own code in the Teaching Machine.</p>
  <p>This step only applies to Windows (but not Windows RT), Mac, and Linux (but not Android). Currently iOS, Android, Windows RT do not support the JRE and so do not support the Teaching Machine.  </p>
  <p>Obtain the Teaching Machine from <a href="http://www.TheTeachingMachine.org/downloads.html" target="_top">TheTeachingMachine.org</a>. Follow the instructions there.</p>
