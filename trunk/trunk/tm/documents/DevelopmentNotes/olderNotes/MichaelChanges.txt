CodeDisplay changes

  
        -   Height of highlight & cursor adjusted
        -   Optional line numbering added 
        -   syntax colouring added
        -   added tab expansion
        -   added colouring for line numbers
        -   made syntax colours, fonts + highlighting configurable
	-   line numbering is Configurable & view menu controlled

TMMainFrame and TMBigApplet
	took view menu and line-numbering support out.
	Now view menu passed as argument to BigApplet constructor and then on to DisplayManager
	constructor.

new ViewStateManager added to DisplayEngine package (singleton class)
Manages view menu
calls appropriate listeners and passes calls down to appropriate displays.
Special code require for each dsplay (only CodeDisplay partly done)

Configuration package reverted to previous version (no menu links at all - menu links are handled 
as needed at the individual display level)


Oct. 8

	Added comments to configuration system. Now C++ style single-line comments can be
	inserted before a parameter or attached to a parameter by a registered configurable
	object.


	Fonts have been made uniform. Font has changed to Monospaced. Ugly!
	Font and highlight color are configurable (but not menu controllable).
	Ugly convinces me I'll have to make fonts configurable at individual
	display level.
	Highlight color config works but font doesn't seem to. Not sure why. Sun
	peer Font shows new changes! Out of time. Have to deal with it when
	I return from New England

    Major new version released several days ago. Completely rewrote StoreDisplay to
    support hierarchial expansion of Datums. Added a number of new classes, vis---
    
        DatumDisplay  - responsible for displaying an individual datum. The workhorse
            of the new system.
            
        Expander - for expander boxes. These are attached to Datums.
        
        DisplayLayoutManager -- an interface. Layout of stores is now handled by a separate
            layout manager to facilitate code sharing between Box and Arrow and linear store
            views.
        
        LinearStoreDisplayManager -- the implementation of the DisplayLayoutManager for standard
            linear store displays.
    
    The following two utilities were put in a separate sub-package allowing them to be friends:
        DisplayTree - for managing the current view of datum hierarchy being displayed. Effectively
            a vector of DatumDisplays
        DDTIterator - iterator objects for the class above.
        
        Finally, over the last couple of days I have added a new class
        
        StringBox -- a simple, lightweight rmo-component that displays a string inside a box, The
            box may or may not have an outline. The string will be properly clipped against it.
            Hooks are in place to allow clipped strings to be displayed in a separate "tool-tip"
            type window when the mouse is clicked inside it. (I judge holding the mouse in the box for
            a time will slow TM down more than we want.)
            
        Bug fixes: 
            amended the configurationServer to eliminate problem of windows not being killed off
            properly when a reduced configuration was loaded.
            
            fixed CodeDisplay so that cursor moved to the correct line all the time (this may still
            need a bit of magic constant fine tuning).

    Finally works with new StringBoxes. Leader algorithm reworked entirely. At least it's cleaner now.
    StoreDisplays are now self-sizing. For wider displays, the boxes will enlarge to fill the space.
    Thus one fast way to see the contents of a string clipped by abox is to enlarge its store to full TM size.
        
 Dec. 11th
	Fixed bug in DisplayManager that didn't put lineNumbering into a new file loaded when it was
	in the old one.
	Fixed bug in CodeDisplay that made lineNumbering fowl up alignments. Also line numbers start at 1.

Dec 13th.
	Implemented mutable titles (but permanent names) in display windows.
	Fixed bug in StringBox that had highlighting wiping out box boundaries.
