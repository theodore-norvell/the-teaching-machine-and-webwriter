             the rights in other media and formats.</p>
           <p>All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved,
             including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(c)

           <p>All other moral rights are waived. This means the Original Author(s)

             including, but limited to, associating the Work with a particular

       <li><strong>Restrictions.</strong> The licence granted in Section 3 above

           <ol type="a">
             <li>You may Use the Work only under the terms of this Licence, and
               You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
               for, this Licence with every copy or soundrecordings of the Work
               You Use. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that
               alter or restrict the terms of this or the recipients' exercise
               of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work.
               You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and
               to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not Use the Work with
               any technological measures that control access or use of the Work
               in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this Licence Agreement.
                 <p>The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective
                   Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
                   from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
                   Licence.</p>
                 <p>If You create a Collective Work, upon request from any Licensor
                   You must, to the extent practicable, include or remove from
                   the Collective Work any credit required by clause 4(d).</p>
                 <p>If You create a Derivative Work, upon request from any Licensor
                   You must, to the extent practicable, include or remove from
                   the Derivative Work any credit required by clause 4(d).</p>
             </li>
             <li>You may Use a Derivative Work only under the terms of this Licence,
               a later version of this Licence that contains the same Licence
               Elements, or a Creative Commons iCommons licence that contains
               the same Licence Elements (e.g. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike
               2.5 Japan).
                 <p>You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
                   for, this Licence or other licence specified in the previous
                   sentence with every copy or soundrecording of each Derivative
                   Work You Use.</p>
                 <p>You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works
                   that alter or restrict the terms of this Licence or the recipients'
                   exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep
                   intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer
                   of warranties.</p>
                 <p>You may not Use the Derivative Work with any technological
                   measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
                   inconsistent with the terms of this Licence Agreement.</p>
                 <p>The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated
                   in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective
                   Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject
                   to the terms of this Licence.</p>
             </li>
             <li>You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section
               3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed
               toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
               The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means
               of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to
               be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
               monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
               compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.</li>
             <li>If you Use the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works,
               You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give
               credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing to
               the (i) Original Author(s) by using his, her or its name (or pseudonym)
               if supplied; and/or (ii) if the Original Author(s) and/or Licensor
               designate another party or parties (eg. a sponsor institution,
               publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright
               notice or terms of service or by other reasonable means, then
               to such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to
               the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier,
               if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
               unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
               information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work,
               a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
               (e.g.,<span class="style1"> "French translation of the Work by Original Author(s)</span>," or "<span class="style1">Screenplay
               based on original Work by Original Author</span>"). Such credit may be
               implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
               in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum
               such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship
               credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other
               comparable authorship credit.</li>
           </ol>
       </li>
       <li><strong>Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer.</strong> UNLESS
         OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS

               stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
               any such election will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or

               under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue
