/**
 * <p>Layable {@link higraph.view.ComponentView
 * view components} are designed to be laid out by a {@link
 * higraph.view.layout.SgLayoutManager
 * layout manager}. The layout process computes values for the next location
 * and size of layable view components. In some cases (
 * {@link higraph.view.EdgeView edges} in particular
 * but possibly {@link higraph.view.BranchView branches}
 * as well) the {@link higraph.view.layout.SgLayoutManager
 * layout manager} may also have to compute the entire new {@link java.awt.Shape shape}
 * of a viewable component.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In essence, then, layable objects permit the setting of their
 * {@link java.awt.Shape nextShape} and the querying of the current
 * {@link java.awt.Shape nextShape}. Information on their current
 * {@link java.awt.Shape Shape} is not directly available. This is because their Shape object
 * may not exist at all (for example, when a Node has been newly created).</p>
 * 
 *  <p>This works because a postCondition of a doTranslation routine is that
 *  the {@link java.awt.Shape nextShape} and {@link java.awt.Shape Shape}
 *  objects of any affected {@link
 *  higraph.view.ComponentView Component Views} are
 *  equal. Thus the normal sequence of events is<ol>
 *    <li>do a layout to compute {@link java.awt.Shape next shapes}</li>
 *    <li>do a transition to the new state</li>
 *    <li>repeat.</li></ol></p>
 * 
 * <p>In the event that a {@link
 * higraph.view.layout.SgLayoutManager
 * layout manager} were to use the existing values of
 * {@link java.awt.Shape nextShape} to calculate the new values, it
 * is possible a missed doTransition would simply result in accumulated
 * layouts. However, many managers will just layout components anew without
 * regard to how they were laid out the last time, in which case
 * doTranslation will just put into effect the last
 * {@link
 * higraph.view.layout.SgLayoutManager#layoutLocal()
 * layoutLocal()} call.</p>
