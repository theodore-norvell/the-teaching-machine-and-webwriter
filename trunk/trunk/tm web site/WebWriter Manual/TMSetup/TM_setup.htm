<H1>Setting Up the Teaching Machine on Your Own Computer </H1>
<div align="left">
  <p>The Teaching Machine itself is written in Java.</p>
  <p>To display our examples on our web pages we also employ JavaScript.</p>
  <p>Thus you must have both Java and JavaScript enabled in your browser.</p>
  <p>You must also have Java (specifically the Java Runtime Environment or JRE)
    installed on your computer.</p>
  <p>You must also have a recent, supported browser    .</p>
  <h2>Supported Browsers</h2>
  <p>We test the Teaching Machine and the web pages on recent versions of </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Firefox</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Derived Browsers</h3>
  <p>Firefox uses the same codebase as Mozilla so although we don't test other Mozilla browsers explicitly, we do expect that both
    the web pages and the Teaching Machine will run on them (as long as they
    are set up properly and Java is installed). </p>
  <h3>Planned Support</h3>
  <p>We plan to add the following browser to our supported list:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Safari (latest version only)   </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Unsupported Browsers</h3>
  <p>These browsers are not supported and are not likely to be supported. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Internet Explorer versions earlier than 6</li>
    <li>Google Chrome</li>
    <li>Other browsers not mentioned above</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Operating Systems Supported</h2>
  <p>Operating systems are not an issue. <em>per se,</em> except to the degree
    that they can or cannot run modern browsers or the JRE</p>
  <p>The Teaching Machine is known to run on Windows XP, Linux and the Mac OS.</p>
  <h2>Installing the TM on your Machine</h2>
  <h3>1. Get the JRE </h3>
  <p>You must get and install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). This allows
    Java to run on your computer. Make sure you get the version appropriate for
  your operating system. Here's Sun's get JRE button. </p>
  <p><a href="http://java.com/java/download/index.jsp?cid=jdp76697" target="_blank"><img width="100" height="43" border="0" style="margin: 8px;" alt="GetJava Download Button" title="GetJava" src="http://java.com/en/img/everywhere/getjava_med.gif?cid=jdp76697"></a></p>
  <p>Just follow Sun's download and installation instructions. (Did we mention
    you should be sure to get the version appropriate for your operating system?)</p>
  <h3>2. Get a Modern Browser</h3>
  <p>Firefox is the browser we recommend. Make sure you have a recent version.
    You can get it here.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.firefox.com" target="_blank" >
	    <img alt="Get Firefox!" title="Get Firefox!" src="http://sfx-images.mozilla.org/affiliates/Buttons/88x31/get.gif"/>
    </a></p>
  <p>Alternatively, you may use a recent version of Internet Explorer which you
    may get from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> </p>
  <h3>3. Setting Up Firefox </h3>
  <p>You must set up Firefox so that it will use both Java and
        JavaScript.</p>
  <p>Here's how it is done in Firefox, as of Feb. 15, 2006.</p>
  <p>Click on <code>Tools</code> and choose <code>Options</code>, as shown below </p>
  <p><img src="tools_options.gif" width="1072" height="517"> </p>
  <p>You will get the following screen. Pick the <code>Content</code> tab as shown and make
    sure</p>
  <p><code>Block Popup Windows</code> is unchecked</p>
  <p><code>Enable Java</code> is checked</p>
  <p><code>Enable Javascript</code> is checked.</p>
  <p>The others don't matter.   </p>
  <p><img src="java_and_javascript.gif" width="680" height="618"> </p>
  <p>Click <code>OK</code> and restart your browser. </p>
  <h3>3 (alt). Setting Up IE </h3>
  <p>You must set up IE so that it will use both Java and JavaScript.</p>
  <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Microsoft has changed setups overnight in the past. If they do
    so again, and your browser is automatically updated, it may invalidate these
    instructions.</p>
  <p>Here's how it is done in IE, as of Feb. 15, 2006 using IE version 6.0.2900.2180.xpsp_sp2_gdr.050301-1519
    (and thank-you so much, Microsoft, for not allowing me to cut and paste this
  from my help-about box).</p>
  <p>Click on <code>Tools</code> and choose <code>Internet Options</code>, as
    shown below </p>
  <p><img src="IE_tools_options.gif" width="733" height="429"></p>
  <p>Click on the <code>Security</code> tab and click <code>Internet</code></p>
  <p><img src="IE_Security_Custom.gif" width="406" height="469"></p>
  <p>Now, <code>select Custom Level...</code> to get the window below. Note,
    there are a lot of settings so you will have to scroll down to find the <code>Java
    VM</code> settings shown below. You want to make sure that <code>Disable
    Java</code> is not selected.
    As you can see here, <code>High safety</code> will work just fine.</p>
  <p>Before you click <code>OK</code> scroll down again&#8230;</p>
  <p> <img src="IE_VM.gif" width="353" height="422"></p>
  <p> &#8230;to find these settings: Make sure that <code>Scripting of Java Applets</code>    is checked <code>Enable</code>.</p>
  <p><img src="IE_scripting.gif" width="353" height="422"></p>
  <p>Now you can click <code>OK</code>. That will get you back to the <code>Security</code> tab.
    Now select the <code>Advanced</code> tab and scroll down until you see these
    check boxes. Select the <code>Java(Sun) JRE</code> and not the <code>Microsoft
    VM</code> (although that ought to work for
    the moment, we expect to leave the Microsoft VM behind soon). </p>
  <p><img src="IE_Sun.gif" width="406" height="469"></p>
  <p>Now you can click <code>OK</code>. </p>
  <p>Close your browser and restart it to make sure all settings take effect. </p>
