Button bug is repaired

codeDisplay

1. Backup button is no longer greyed out
2. highlight, cursor block have been adjusted

3. now includes a method called

void setLineNumbers(boolean on)

which switches line numbering on and off
(I did NOT add a button for this because title
bar is already full. Suggest it be added to the main menu.)
