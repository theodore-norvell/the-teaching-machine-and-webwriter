/**
 * TO BE DONE: If I try to use the new BLIT_SCROLL_MODE clipping doesn't work
 * properly with storeDisplays and the STDisplay (although its fine with the
 * codeDisplay. The blitting algorithm queues all graphics changes and then
 * paints them at once. While store displays start out well behaved they can
 * appear to stop clipping sometimes when another subwindow is brought into
 * focus. To duplicate the problem, change mode to blit mode, run the TM and
 * load the arrayToPntr program from cpp-conformance-tests. StepOver to load
 * the first two or three variables into the stack, then expand the first
 * variable which is a large array. Scroll down so the array is clipped top and
 * bottom. Now click on a the heap and (if it is below the stack), the array
 * will overflow the bottom. Click on the symtab and it will overflow the top.
 * Resizing the stack subwindow has no effect. Its contents now appear to
 * be being written on the screen behind, as if the parent graphics context is
 * being used. A dump of the clip rectangle from the store paint routine shows
 * the clip to be set properly, arguing the correct context is being used.
 * 
 * Part of the problem appears to be reconciling my legacy
 * code (which has its own viewport model) with the new Swing approaches (which
 * have an explicit viewport model). WorkArea should be carefully scrutinized
 * and possibly revised so that it works properly with blit mode. Moreover
 * the calling of layout managers (particularly for the store) should be examined
 * (see drawArea method for StoreDisplay) to make sure layout is redone for all
 * events that would require it instead of just on a size change (e.g., should
 * a scroll change force a relayout). Finally, my preclipping of stores is not
 * handling compound datums properly. firstDatum, lastDatum refer to unexpanded
 * datums even when datums are expanded. size of the view is changing properly
 * so there's no reason first and last datum can't be more accurate.
